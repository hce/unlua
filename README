Call UnrealScript from Lua, use Lua scripts inside Deus Ex.

To compile, you need the Deus Ex public headers, included in the Deus
Ex SDK. It also requires certain modifications to those headers, most
notably to the FString and FName classes, which I'm not permitted to
dirstibute. You'll have to deduce what these modifications were and
redo them yourself, I'm afraid. (The code won't compile otherwise)

It most likely compiles only with VC++6.
